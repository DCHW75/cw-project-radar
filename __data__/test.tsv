5GZORRO	225650	ICT-20-2019-2020	RIA	Nov 2019	Apr 2022	€4,999,965	Zero-touch security and trust for ubiquitous computing and connectivity in 5G networks.	Despite the progress of last years, 5G today is not yet at a stage of complete achievement of the promised performances and functions: different application profiles (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) do not easily coexist in network slices; slicing is casted in various different forms; network analytics are not at end-to-end scope; services do not span multiple operator domains yet.     5GZORRO consortium envisions the evolution of 5G to achieve truly production-level support of diverse Vertical applications, which coexist on a highly pervasive shared network infrastructure, through automated end-to-end network slicing, across multiple operators and infrastructure/resource providers, who can share heterogeneous types of resources (spectrum, virtualized radio access, virtualized edge/core).     5GZORRO uses distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) to implement cognitive network orchestration and management with minimal manual intervention (Zero-Touch Automation). Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are adopted to implement flexible and efficient distributed security and trust across the various parties involved in a 5G end-to-end service chain. With these, we can implement an evolved 5G Service Layer for Smart Contracts among multiple non-trusted parties, to allow SLA monitoring, spectrum sharing, intelligent and automated data-driven resource discovery and management. Our cross domain security & trust orchestration coupled with service lifecycle automation can enforce security policies in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments.     Three use cases validate our research in 5GBarcelona and 5TONIC/Madrid test facilities: Smart Contracts for Ubiquitous Computing/Connectivity, Dynamic Spectrum Allocation, Pervasive virtual CDNs over 3rd-party edge resources.     5GZORRO target stakeholders are telecom operators, vertical slice owners/operators, spectrum owners, regulators, passive/ active facility owners, many of which are in our consortium of 13 top 5G players from 7 different EU countries.			
LOCARD	223296	SU-FCT02-2018-2019-2020	RIA	May 2019	Apr 2022	€6,833,385	Lawful evidence collecting and continuity platform development	Digital evidence is currently an integral part of criminal investigations, and not confined to pure cybercrime cases. Criminal behaviours like financial frauds, intellectual property theft, industrial espionage, and terrorist networks leverage the Internet and cyberspace. The very ubiquity of digital devices, e.g. smartphones, in modern society makes digital evidence extremely relevant for investigations about all kinds of criminal behaviour like murder, contraband activities, and people smuggling, to name a few.  Due to its nature, the use of digital evidence in a court of law has always been challenging. It is critical that it should be accompanied by a proper chain of custody, guaranteeing its source and integrity.  LOCARD aims to provide a holistic platform for chain of custody assurance along the forensic workflow, a trusted distributed platform allowing the storage of digital evidence metadata in a blockchain.  Each node of LOCARD will be able to independently set its own permission policies and to selectively share access to digital evidence with other nodes when deemed necessary and upon proper authorization through fine-grained policies. LOCARD's modularity will also allow diverse actors to tailor the platform to their specific needs and role in the digital forensic workflow, from preparation and readiness, to collection, to analysis and reporting.  LOCARD will have a crowdsource module to collect citizen reports of selected violations, a crawler to detect and correlate online deviant behaviour, and a toolkit for investigators that will assist them in collecting online and offline evidence.  This will be powered by an immutable storage and an identity management system that will protect privacy and handle access to evidence data using a Trusted Execution Environment. Blockchain technology will not only guarantee that information about the evidence cannot be tampered with, but allow interoperability without the need for a trusted third party.			
INSPIRE-5Gplus	225664	ICT-20-2019-2020	RIA	Nov 2019	Oct 2022	€5,993,381	INtelligent Security and PervasIve tRust for 5G and Beyond	The goal of INSPIRE-5Gplus is to advance security of 5G and Beyond networks via two main approaches: (1) by leveraging/extending existing assets such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Remote Attestation/Path Proof/RCA (Root Cause Analysis), and end-to-end liability management between parties, and (2) by introducing novel solutions/paradigms exploiting the potential of new trends including AI/ML and Blockchains. Accordingly, the INSPIRE-5Gplus project will address key security challenges against the concrete and efficient realisation of 5G through vertical applications, ranging from autonomous and connected cars to Critical Industry 4.0 (under specific regulation constraints).   Grounded in an integrated network management system and relevant frameworks, INSPIRE-5Gplus is entirely devoted to improve security at various dimensions (i.e., overall vision, use cases, architecture, integration to network management, assets, and models). It is also committed to deliver actionable results and enablers for all relevant stakeholders at both Program and Community levels. These outcomes will serve the crucial objectives of intelligent security and pervasive trust for future connected systems where Security will not be software-defined only, but will also be governed by Algorithms (AI, ML, Modeling, Optimization) to realize new concepts such as pro-active security while being trustworthy. Through its objectives, INSPIRE-5Gplus will deliver unique assets to achieve intelligent and trusted multi-tenancy (i.e. confident, evidence-based, and liable) across multi-tenants infrastructure, whilst also improving the control of systems, vulnerabilities and compromises for the infrastructure owners and tenants.			
AERAS	226275	MSCA-RISE-2019	MSCA-RISE	Dec 2019	Nov 2023	€1,435,200	A CybEr range tRaining platform for medicAl organisations and systems Security	AERAS aims to develop a realistic and rapidly adjustable cyber range platform for systems and organisations in the critical healthcare sector, to effectively prepare stakeholders with different types of responsibility and levels of expertise in defending high-risk, critical cyber-systems and organizations against advanced, known and new cyber-attacks, and reduce their security risks. The platform will be a virtual cyberwarfare solution enabling the simulation of the operation and effects of security controls and offering hands-on training on their development, assessment, use and management.  The platform will be based on an evidence-based approach where virtual cyberwarfare and simulations are configured according to evidence regarding: (i) the occurrence of cyber threats, and (ii) the effectiveness of the operation of the internal and external system defence mechanisms. Evidence will be collected by multi- faceted real-time monitoring and assessed according to Cyber Range Security Assurance (CRSA) models specifying potential cyber-attacks, the security mechanisms used against them, and the methods for assessing their effectiveness. The AERAS solution will be delivered at TRL-7 and validated through two different pilots in the healthcare sector: (i) a hospital medical systems pilot; and (ii) a public health systems pilot.			
UP2DATE	225496	ICT-01-2019	RIA	Jan 2020	Dec 2022	€3,846,290	Intelligent software-UPDATE technologies for safe and secure mixed-criticality and high performance cyber physical systems	Mixed-Criticality Cyber-Physical Systems (MCCPS) deployed in critical domains like automotive and railway are starting to use Over The Air Software Updates (OTASU) for functionality improvement, bug fixing, and solving security vulnerabilities (among others). But, OTASU entails several difficulties: 1) Safety including non-functional properties like real-time, functional safety, and energy-efficiency. 2) Security. OTASU creates entry points for hackers 3) Availability. During updates the system is not available. While this is just inconvenient for mainstream devices, this is not acceptable for critical MCCPS that must remain active during operation.   Additionally, computing performance needs are bigger and therefore complex hardware platforms based on multicore processors and accelerators are used in MCCPS. Such complex hardware platforms, software applications are subject to intricate dependences in their functional and non-functional behaviour.   For facing these two trends in MCCPS: OTASU and complex hardware platforms, that entails relevant research challenges, the UP2DATE project propose: a new software paradigm for SAfety and SEcurity (SASE) software updates for intelligent and resource intensive MCCPS, promoting a safety and security concept that builds around composability and modularity as main properties to enable a dynamic (post-deployment) validation of SASE properties.  A high quality and complementary consortium comprising knowledge generators (IKL, BSC and OFFIS) plus technology integrators (IAV and TTA) and two end uses from the automotive and railway sector (MM and CAF), will be able to test in two uses cases a new software architecture that will enable the runtime deployment of new (mixed-criticality) applications remotely (patching existing functions or extending the functionality) in heterogeneous computing platforms.   The total budget foreseen for this research project is around €3.8M.			
1-SWARM	226512	ICT-01-2019	RIA	Jan 2020	Dec 2022	€4,997,523	Integrated development and operations management framework for cyber-physical systems of systems under the paradigm of swarm intelligence	Recent years have seen the widespread diffusion of low-cost computational systems, triggering the transition towards even further decentralization towards the Edge of autonomic intelligence. While in the consumer domain this transformation is happening very fast, industrial applications are inevitably more conservative and require solid methodological and technological grounds to guarantee this transition to be dependable.  1-SWARM project focuses on the design-operations for CPSoS with the specific focus on industrial sector of large-scale distribution and logistics. The project aims at achieving industrially acceptable level of robustness of CPSoS whose operation emerges as “Swarm Intelligence”. 1-SWARM’s solution will span across different steps of the value chain, connecting intelligence through the digital domain to maximize their effectiveness and reliability. The objective is to provide a methodological and technological framework, modular and re-usable (“Swarm Intelligence DevOps Framework”), for the engineering of the three major aspects of CPSoS: i) The HW/SW runtime platform that sustains their operations; ii) The distributed and orchestrated Intelligence that guarantees their autonomic behavior; iii) The extension of their “existence” into the cyber-domain for a full life-cycle approach.  Key to the exploitability of 1-SWARM’s result is the demonstration of its potentialities for 4 different application scenarios, whose requirements come from cross-domain use-cases, whose variability allows extensive validation of the project technologies: 1) Manufacturing CPSoS for food packaging; 2) Logistics CPSoS for reconfigurable material handling; 3) Fleets of intelligent AGVs in complex dynamic environment; 4) Aerial drones flock for extensive monitoring of retails shops.  Strong of its open and standard-based approach, 1-SWARM will create an international collaborative framework for the CPSoS domain, supporting extensively relevant standardization activities.
